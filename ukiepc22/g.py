# A word is written on a board and then you and your opponent take turns to shorten the word
# by removing one or more letters from the start and/or end to form new words. Each letter of
# the alphabet is assigned a point score, and if you delete a letter you get its points added to your
# score.
# Your goal is to receive as small a score as possible. What is the lowest score you can get if your
# opponent plays well?
