# Hook-a-duck is the traditional sport of floating rubber ducks in a tub, distributing long hooked
# poles to participants, and awarding points to participants for retrieving their duck.
# Today we are organising the first world championship in hook-a-duck-ery. To facilitate the event,
# we used a local river instead of a single tub and floated each contestantâ€™s duck down to some
# distinct spot on the opposite bank. Now, the contestants will line up at their unique assigned
# places and try to latch their own duck fastest.
# However, not everyone can retrieve their duck at the same time. If two participants would
# otherwise need to cross poles to fetch ducks, we will have to organise them into separate rounds.
# How many rounds, at minimum, do we need to organise?


# bascically count number of intersections

# 3
# 5 1 2
# 2 4 1
